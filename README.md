# *My journey into Artificial Intelligence*

I will document all the exercises and projects while learning
AI. 

#Coursera
#=======

## Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

1. ([Linear Regression](./GradientDescent/LinearRegression))
Basic implementation of gradient descent with linear regression
for multiple variables. Also, used scikit-learn was used.

2. ([Logistic Regression](./GradientDescent/LogisticRegression))
Basic implementation of gradient descent with logistic regression
for multiple variables.

## Advanced Learning Algorithms: Neural Networks

3. ([NN with Tensorflow](./NeuralNetwork/CoffeeRoasting))
Neural network to find out optimal coffee roast with Tensorflow
and a python implementation. 


# Kaggle

## Courses and Projects

Kaggle has several courses that built on top of each other.  Here's the flow:
Python --> Intro to Machine Learning --> Intro to deep learning --> Computer
vision.
For each course taken and projects completed, you will find associated codes.
